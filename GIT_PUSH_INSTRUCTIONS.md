## Authentication Required

To push to GitHub, you need to authenticate. Choose one of these methods:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name it: "Web3DRender Push"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Push using token:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - When prompted for username: Enter `Rohit-Saklani`
   - When prompted for password: **Paste your token** (not your GitHub password)

### Option 2: GitHub CLI

1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Push:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: SSH Key (Most Secure)

1. **Generate SSH key** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "rohit@ihubiitmandi.in"
   ```

2. **Add SSH key to GitHub:**
   - Copy your public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your key and save

3. **Change remote to SSH:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Rohit-Saklani/Web3DRender.git
   ```

4. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
